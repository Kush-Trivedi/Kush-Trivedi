- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kush Trivedi.
- ðŸ‘€ I am a highly motivated learner intrigued by all aspects of Big Data Analytics with a particular focus on data analysis & science. Years of varsity debating have given me the undeniably infuriating yet advantageous ability to play devil's advocate to most ideas, allowing me to question and further strengthen any analysis. Additionally, my strengths lie in being able to communicate cogently and effectively.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Azure Data Science DP-100, DA-100 & Tableau Data Analyst certifications.
